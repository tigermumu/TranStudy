ABSTRACT
Algorand is a new cryptocurrency that con rms transactions with latency on the order of a minute while scaling to many users. Algorand ensures that users never have divergent views of con rmed transactions, even if some of the users are malicious and the network is temporarily partitioned. In contrast, existing cryptocurrencies allow for temporary forks and therefore require a long time, on the order of an hour, to con rm transactions with high con dence.
